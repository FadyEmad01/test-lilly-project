The West 14th Street Promenade created a "third space" for community enjoyment while enhancing connections to Hudson River Park and enlivening the retail corridor.

// Through the repurposing of the curblane and transformation of the wide, two-way underutilized roadbed along West 14th Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, locals and visitors alike now get to experience five new gathering areas, lush landscaping, and in the future, opportunities for public art and small concessions, enhancing the pedestrian experience.

// The Meatpacking District Management Association (Meatpacking BID) is lead the project in partnership with design partners Street Plans and TYLin (formerly Sam Schwartz Engineering), with support from the New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT), and Manhattan Community Boards 2 and 4, as well as local elected officials.`,

// In partnership with the Whitney Museum, we invite you to an immersive experience and to "Step into Hopper." This program brings 3-D recreations of Edward Hopper's paintings to life, designed for today's visitors by Theresa Rivera Design, allowing you to step inside and pose within these paintings.

// From July 11 - 13, in celebration of West Side Fest and Hopper's 143rd birthday, you can explore life-size recreations of his iconic works: Nighthawks, Soir Bleu, and Early Sunday Morning. The Whitney Museum is home to the largest collection of Hopper work.

// • Nighthawks - Take a seat inside Hopper's iconic diner scene
// • Soir Bleu - Transporting visitors into Hopper's introspective take on French café culture. Tillie the Clown will be present at select times on Friday, July 11, Saturday, July 12, and Sunday, July 13 to set the scene.
// • Early Sunday Morning - Step off the bustling streets of present-day New York City and into the stillness of this portrait of Seventh Avenue in the 1930s.

// See key Hopper works and other icons from the Whitney Collection in the new monumental collection show, "Untitled", (America), now on view.`,

"The District has an energy you can't find anywhere else," says Ong. "It's the collision of the industrial past and the high-fashion future. That tension inspires every bouquet I arrange."

Judy discusses her journey from a small pop-up on 13th Street to becoming a staple of the neighborhood's aesthetic identity.`,
